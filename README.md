# GTA5ModsPakistan

Welcome to the **GTA5ModsPakistan** project! This is an improved version of the original GTAVModsPakistan website. The project was a collaborative effort: the design and UI/UX were handled by my friend Abdul Haseeb, while I focused on the development and coding.

## Demo

## Features

- **Collaborative Design and Development**: 
  - **UI/UX & Design**: Abdul Haseeb.
  - **Development & Coding**: Hashir Kashif.
- **PHP Version (Not Pushed)**: I also created a PHP version where the client can easily upload and modify mods. However, this version is not included in the repository for security reasons.
